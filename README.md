* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a effective tool of managing task and progress of students in project based module.
  * as a case study
* The project builds on to enhance the software project for a desktop application (called AddressBook) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `T_Assiant`, because it is designed for TA of project based module such as CS2103 to help them manage task and track the progress of their studuents.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[T_Assiant Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
