### Project: T_Assistant

T_Assistant is a **desktop app for CS2103 tutors managing their students, groups and tasks** optimized for use via a
Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, T_Assistant can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
