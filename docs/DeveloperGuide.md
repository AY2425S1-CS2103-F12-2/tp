## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [
`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [
`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in
charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `del_s sno/A0123456A`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [
`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [
`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [
`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [
`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("dg gn/CS2103-F12-2")` API
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `dg gn/CS2103-F12-2` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteGroupCommandParser`, `DeleteGroupCommand` and `CommandResult` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a
  `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [
`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which
`Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student`
needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [
`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="800" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<box type="info">

**Note:** For simplicity, certain details such as conditional checks, parsing
and more detailed implementation on model changes have been omitted.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Delete Group feature

The `Delete Group` feature allows users to delete an existing group in the address book given a group's name.

The following shows the activity diagram when the user executes the `del_g` command:
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteGroupActivityDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteGroupCommandAD" />

#### Usage

**Syntax:** `del_g/dg gn/GROUP_NAME [gn/GROUP_NAME]...`

**Example:** `dg gn/CS2103-F12-2`

#### Implementation details

1. User has the application launched with at least 1 group added.
2. User executes `lg` to view all groups. For this example, the user wishes to delete `CS2103-F12-2`.
3. The user executes `dg gn/CS2103-F12-2` to delete the group with a group name `CS2103-F12-2`. The command is parsed in
   the
   `AddressBookParser`.
4. `DeleteGroupCommandParser` is created and gets the group name of the group to be deleted. The group name is used to
   construct a `DeleteGroupCommand` object.
5. The `DeleteGroupCommand` object then calls `deleteGroup(group)` in the `ModelManager` with the specified group to be
   deleted. This method deletes the specified `Group` in the model.
7. Finally, the `DeleteGroupCommand` returns the `CommandResult`.

##### Note

This feature will also remove `Students` in the `Group` and reset their `Group`, and delete all `Tasks` related to the
`Group`, but the details are omitted.

#### Sequence diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for delete group works:
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteGroupCommand"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteGroupCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect 1:** Usage of GroupName as identifer

1. **Design #1: Use GroupName**

* Pro: More deliberate and since GroupNames are more complex, the user will be more aware of their decision
* Con: Must type a lot

2. **Design #2:** Use Index

* Pro: Easy and quick
* Con: Possible for user to mistype the wrong number

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionHistory`. It stores an ArrayList `versions` of ReadOnlyAddressBook.

Whenever there are changes made to the AddressBook, a defensive copy of the AddressBook is created and stored in the
ArrayList. `VersionHistory` also stores a pointer to the current version of the addressbook.

If newly initialized, this pointer is set to -1. We have set a maximum number of versions to be able to stored at 100.
Once this limit is reached, the earliest entry in the ArrayList will be deleted by `VersionHistory` so that a new
version can be stored.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionHistory#addVersion(Model model)`â€” Saves the current state to its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undoVersion()`â€” Restores the previous version from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redoVersion()`â€” Restores a previously undone version from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Command` abstract class: `Command#addVersion()`, `Command#undoVersion()`
and `Command#redoVersion()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Implementation details

1. User has the application launched and has made at least 1 change to the system.
2. For our example, user executes 'asg' and adds a student to a specific group. However, this was done incorrectly and
   the student is added into an incorrect group.
3. The user executes `undo`. This command is parsed into the `AddressBookParser`.
4. An `UndoCommandParser` object is constructed and it constructs a `UndoCommand` object.
5. The `UndoCommand` object then calls `updateVersionHistory(versionHistory, model)`. This in turn calls `undoVersion()`
   of `VersionHistory`.
6. This updates the pointer in `VersionHistory` to point to the previous version. If the pointer is already set to 0,
   there is nothing to undo and an exception will be thrown.
7. The new addressbook is then saved in the model.
8. Finally, the `UndoCommand` returns the `CommandResult`.
9. The `RedoCommand` follows the exact same workflow as above, but its `updateVersionHistory(versionHistory, model)`
   calls upon `redoVersion` instead, updating the pointer to the previously undone version.

#### Sequence diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for how undo works:
